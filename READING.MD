# Xendit Invoice PDF

### Design Methodology

The application is designed using ReactJs which is one of the most popular Frontend Framework out there.

I used react-pdf package for my project to generate the pdf files on the fly. React-pdf is a very powerful plugin as it allows use to have control over the design via their well-defined components.

I kept the project as simple as possible by not using too many libraries as to reduce dependencies. There is no state management as the date is exported and used immediately from Invoice API.
